# COVID19 Tracking App (RETIRED)

<p>
This was a freelance project of mine in early 2020, consisted of one <b>React Native application</b> and a <b>scraper server</b>.
</p><p>
After Google and Apple updated their Play Store and App Store policies to reject all medical applications those not authenticated by a known institution, this app left unpublished.
</p><p>
The server has been shut down in <b>March 2020</b> to cut the costs of an unused app.
